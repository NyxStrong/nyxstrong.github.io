                        Hello There,
                        <br>
                        My name is Nyx. I am currently working on getting my degree in computer science. 
                        So far I've only taken CIS-120 (Intro to Computer programming) working with C# and 
                        CIS-130 (Web Development 1) which is where I learned to make this website.
                        <br><br>
                        Outside of all that I've learned some Python, Rust, and a little java. 
                        As well as bash scripting if you count that.
                        <br><br>
                        Overall I wanna get into the game design side of comuter science. 
                        It's always been and interest of mine with my first expirences in coding being lua for roblox and java for minecraft modding.

                        <p>This little project is a simple python script that allows me to use a midi slider board to control the volume on my computer through pulse audio among other things.</p>
